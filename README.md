# Hi visitor üëã

I'm Aline Legendre a web developer in Bordeaux (France). üç∑

For 5 months I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony, and more at Wild Code School Bordeaux.

During my training at Wild Code School, I had to create different projects :

  - [**Job IT Better by Externatic**](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/2023-02-PHP-Bordeaux-Externatic) : my final project developed in 2 months with 4 classmates in partnership with Externatic. It's a job search website, where you can find a job, or post a job offer.
  - [**Estimma√ºs**](https://github.com/KevinDavoust/Hackathon2-PHP-estimmaus) : üëë project winning the 1st place of the second Wild Code School Hackathon 2023 in partnership with Emma√ºs. The goal was to create an application to estimate the price of a smartphone in 48h with 4 classmates.
  - [**Circuit**](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/2023-02-PHP-Bordeaux-P2-RytaMitsublog) : my second project developed in 1 month and a half with 3 classmates. It's a blog about new technologies. You can find articles about web development, but also about new technologies in general. The admin can create, edit and delete articles. The users can read the articles and leave comments.
  - [**C√©oukonva ?**](https://github.com/Urzaag/c-oukonva) : project winning the 2nd place of the Wild Code School Hackathon 2023. The goal was to create a holiday themed website. We choose to create a website to help the tap and sock fans to find the perfect campsite.
  - [**Body & Soul**](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/2023-03-PHP-Bordeaux-P1-SalleDeSport) : my first project developed in 2 weeks with 3 classmates. It's a gym website in HTML and CSS.

Now, I'm work in my portfolio, but it's not finished yet. I'm working on it, and I will update it soon.

I'm currently looking for a job, so if you like my work, feel free to contact me in [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aline-legendre-aa8b1426a/).
